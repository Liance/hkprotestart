# A Little Fall of Rain
*Sep 27, 2019*

It's 5ys since the Umbrella Mvmt. We failed to win suffrage then but had vowed to return. Well, we're back. But the umbrella as a symbol has changed and reflects how much HKers have learnt from that first awakening 1/7

The umbrella became a symbol of resistance 5ys ago. And it still is. In a lot of art from this mvmt, the umbrella is used as a shield against teargas and other projectiles. Note bauhinia on the black brolly - our very city has become a bulwark vs. creeping authoritarianism 2/7

This time round, we see images of umbrellas as weapons: frontline 'braves' wield umbrellas valiantly like swords, ready to (and also actually) strike. This was a lesson learnt from the UM - peaceful protests yield nothing but greater repression. Defence has turned to offence. 3/7

The 'hero shots' of fighters with umbrellas are inspirational, sure. But HK protest art also very aware of reality - what damage can an everyday object, an ordinary people, possibly do vs. guns and the power that commands them? As the art here suggests, it is not a fair fight 4/7

The other lesson learnt from 5yrs ago was the importance of unity to sustain the mvmt. And with that, the umbrella gains new meaning as a symbol. It offers a space for all to come together - 'brave' or 'peaceful', young or old, rich or poor... We're all in this together. 5/7

It might seem we give UM too much credit for current mvmt. But the art suggests HKers see the two as connected. Note the passing of the baton/brolly here, under *that* Avengers quote. Note how we describe today as a fulfilment of our vow to return, even if it took 5yrs. 6/7

And maybe that's the final most important lesson - that ideas take root and bloom only when their season comes. Below, our bauhinia grow from the support of umbrellas. In the others, the umbrellas *are* the flowers, blossoming across the land. It's only a matter of time 7/?
