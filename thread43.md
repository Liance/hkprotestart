#An Eye for an Eye
*Nov 10 2019*

As HKers reel from Chow's death, it's worth looking at an earlier collective trauma- HKPF shooting a volunteer in the eye- to see how art immortalises & spreads HKer's righteous rage, & what we can learn from the episode.

One recurring image in HK protest art is a bloodied right eye, often bandaged up. It's to memorialise events of 11 Aug, when HKPF shot a beanbag round at a volunteer first aider's head. Photos of the aftermath speak for themselves, but HKPF denies responsibility.

One of our own may be blinded, but we HKers are not - only HKPF have projectiles like the one that hit the woman's head. Within hours, art promoting the airport sit-in for the next day turned raw, bloody, vengeful. "An eye for an eye", "Return the eye, black cops", they say.
