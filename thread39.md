#“It Aways Fits. Eventually.”
*Oct 26 2019*

HKer's masks & respirators for braving teargas hv become synonymous with our pro-democracy mvmt. We trace the art to see how the masks hv evolved in use, & w/ them how new heroes hv arisen from an ordinary ppl.

On 16 Jun, 2 mln HKers made a choice. Many put on their masks, and marched. 

Most were your ordinary 'peaceful' protestor type, their masks the badly-fitting disposable variety - a legacy of SARS & later the☂ Mvmt; flimsy protection against both virus and Big Brother.

Since then, HKers have continued choosing to don their masks. There're 2 main types used: 1st is disposable masks, usu. white/blue/black. 2nd is respirators (‘pig-snouts’) that tend to be depicted in bright pink. (Colors vary IRL by functionality, but let's not go there.)

Disposable masks are associated w/ peaceful 'woleifei's, the ppl who don't expect to get gassed. Their use is mostly to hide identities - we may not be able to enjoy our rights of assembly & speech w/out fear, but we'll still brave what we have to to exercise them.

The respirators are associated w/ those at the teargas buffets. The distinctive pink you see in photos & art are particulate filters, for those in heavy industry in danger from ammonia & chlorine... not made for young ppl fighting for freedom, in danger from their own govt.

Even for frontliners the current setup wasn't a necessity at first. Early pamphlet from Jun rec-ed disposable respirators gd enough for mild teargas. By Jul, materials hd bn thoroughly updated; we knew the fog & hellfire we're up against. And still we chose to walk into it.

We still chose to walk into it, bcos the fog & hellfire was spreading, into our streets & homes. The respirators - & sometimes the face masks - are what allow us to get close enough to the gas & douse it out, to *literally* save our neighborhoods from pain & tears.

Gas masks hv bn vital to safety of journalists too. They didn't start out in full gear, but as HKPF grew to greet them w/ teargas salutes, respirators became a necessity. For journos to uncover truth thru fog of war, they must be able to walk thru it first- and so, masks on.

The masks are HKers' hard choices. The choice to fight for our freedoms of speech & assembly. The choice to protect our neighborhoods & homes. The choice to live in fear, but still, to live!... Choices which we only have to make because of the govt's wilful incompetence.

So when the Anti-Mask Law came into effect on 5 Oct, HKers were livid. Our art rebelled and revelled in the farcical nature of our new reality - HKers sport ludicrous masks & makeup, mocking Lam's govt. 'Is this what you're scared of? Me in my little hair mask? Well, good.'

From this pt, masks became less abt stripping of identity as declaration of one. Masks are displays of HKers' defiance of unjust laws- frontliner w/ 'pig snout' or woleifei w/ Pooh mask- we're in the same boat now. In our art, we are many, but we are also as one, resisting.
