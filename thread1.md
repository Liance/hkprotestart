# Myth and myth-making in HK protest art: a thread 

*(Sep 21, 2019)*

HKers have been fighting for 3 mths, and we've seen how powerful modern myths can be. They frame our battles,  help us we see ourselves as a ppl, but also, they sometimes freeze solid a mvmt that's supposed to 'be water'.

One modern myth we've gone to again and again is the Avengers. They appear here as a bit of a joke early on in mid June, after the govt unleashed tear gas because there were 'rioters'. We joked those few rioters must be superhuman to warrant such overreaction. 😂

It then gets grim. These are from July - the 1st alludes to how Dr Strange 'beats' Dormammu by losing again and again. 2nd is from Endgame - the chance of winning is infinitesimal, and if we lose... So we have to win, whatever it takes.

![A series of photos of major protest milestones: the 1.03 million person march on Jun 9, the 2 million march on Jun 16, the Jun 12 protest, and the Jul 1 occupation of LegCo. Image ends on a screenshot from the movie Doctor Strange, where the protagonist declares, "No, but I can lose. Again. And again. And again. Forever. That makes you my prisoner." This is captioned with a Chinese phrase reading, "Hong Kongers, never defeated!"](images/thread1/t1-p2.jpg)  
*Left to right, top to bottom: 6.9 1.03 million person march. 6.16 2 million person march. 6.12 Wounding of the Bauhinia. 7.1 Hong Kong people's LegCo. Hong Kongers, never defeated!* 
![A screenshot from the movie Doctor Strange, with the words "Whatever it takes" at the top partially fading into dust. The screenshot is annotated with a comment in Chinese: "(If) we lose this time, there is no returning. We must beat them, until 2047." ](images/thread1/t1-p3.jpg)  
*Caption reads: "(If) we lose this time, there is no returning. We must beat them, until 2047."*

By Aug, HKers have *become* the Avengers, because no one was coming to our aid. We're heroes assembling to take on a titan. But sense of dread pervades - note that ref to Ragnorak. Thor comes to that conclusion after deciding he had to burn down his home to save the world. 

![A modified Avengers: Infinity War poster, made to read "Airport: Infinity War" instead, with a background formed from overlaid images of the airport occupation, riot police firing a shotgun, and frontliners with umbrellas up against tear gas. Text at the bottom reads, in Chinese, "Continue to Fly-with-you", a reference to Hong Kong International Airport occupations.](images/thread1/t1-p4.jpg)
*Text at bottom reads: Continue to Fly-With-You.*
![A poster advertising a march on Aug 18 at 3 PM, from Victoria Park to Charter Road. The main slogan reads, Hong Kongers, ASSEMBLE!! as well as "Stop triad violence, limit police chaos" and "Support the Five Demands".](images/thread1/t1-p5.jpg)

![Two photos. The top photo, of the Hong Kong skyline, is captioned, "Hong Kong is not a place". The bottom image, of a street filled during a peaceful march, reads "IT'S A PEOPLE". Hashtag in the corner, in Chinese: "Leaving the island but not the people?"](images/thread1/t1-p6.jpg)

*Text in the middle reads, in Chinese and English, "Hong Kongers, Assemble. We will go together."*

September, Avengers still here, especially Cap. His shield defends our frontline fighters. His words too. We've not given up, even after seeing our friends fail and fall 5 years ago. And we're here to fight. (That's a deep cut, whoever made that ‘permission' poster). 

![Illustration of a frontline protestor in hard hat and half-face respirator, in profile. He is carrying a black bauhinia flag and a Captain America shield. Text on the bottom left reads: 9.18 Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.](images/thread1/t1-p8.jpg)
![Vertically-rotated image of Harcourt Romanticist's redrawing of Liberty Leading the People, with protestors in place of the revolutionaries. Text, in English, reads: some people moved on. BUT NOT US. #FightForFreedom #StandWithHongKong](images/thread1/t1-p9.jpg)
![Illustration of black-on-yellow silhouettes of frontline protestors, extinguishing tear gas with cones as more tear gas canisters come down. Text, in white, reads: Some people moved on/But not us.](images/thread1/t1-p10.jpg)
![Poster advertising un-permitted rally for Sep 15. Image is a illustrated closeup of two hands held together, by two people dressed in yellow. Text on top, in white, reads: We're way past asking for permission.](images/thread1/t1-p11.jpg)

We tapped into Star Wars later. Started as a fun bit of trolling - in early Aug, HKPF arrested a student for buying laser pens, saying they're offensive weapons. 😂 From then on, laser pens (and occasionally toy lightsabers) became very much part of the protest and the art. 

![Yellow-outlined Chinese text, and an English translation of the same, overlaid on an image of galaxies in reference to the Star Wars logo. Text reads: Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Lasers](images/thread1/t1-p12.jpg)
![Modified photograph of a protestor holding up a reflector, on which other people are aiming blue and green laser pointers. The beam from the reflector has been edited to read "Extradition Bill" in white. The image is captioned, "May the force be with us."](images/thread1/t1-p13.jpg)
![Illustration of a frontliner in a black helmet, ballistic goggles, and a half-face respirator, holding a green laser pointer shining at the viewer and a green lightsaber. Text on top reads WE ARE ONE. Text on bottom reads FREEDOM/Got to fight for it.](images/thread1/t1-p14.jpg)
![Two images. Top image is of the Death Star getting ready to fire a green beam of light. Bottom image is a photograph of a protestor holding up a reflector, into which the surrounding people are shining blue and green laser pointers, implying that the protestor in the bottom image is deflecting the shot from the Death Star.](images/thread1/t1-p15.jpg)

The HK version of Tom Jung's iconic Star Wars poster. We are a new hope. China is the Death Star, the police is its enforcer, Vader, and we have tear gas canisters flying instead of X-wings. Note R2 has been unceremoniously replaced by a bin. I don’t know why either. 😂 

![An illustration copying Tom Jung's Star Wars poster, with a male and female protestor taking the place of Luke and Leia, R2-D2 replaced with a Hong Kong style orange trash bin, and flying tear-gas canisters instead of X-wings. Vader in the back has been replaced with a gas-masked riot cop.](images/thread1/t1-p16.jpg)
![An adapted Star Wars movie poster, with Vader in the back replaced with a gas-masked riot cop. Luke in the foreground has been replaced by a protestor in a yellow hard hat, with a half face respirator, a black short-sleeved shirt, and work gloves, holding a green lightsaber aimed straight up. The caption reads: Hong Kong, A New Hope. Text at the bottom in Chinese reads: "All citizens awaken / At the first light of dawn." ](images/thread1/t1-p17.jpg)
*Text at the bottom in Chinese reads: "All citizens awaken / At the first light of dawn."*

Let’s talk Luke. That’s his lightsaber on here (because me = nerd). Not just his, actually. Anakin’s first, then Luke, then passed on to Rey 30 yrs later.  We HKers are just the latest custodians of hope, part of a fight that started long before we were born.

![A poster advertising a march at Sham Shui Po on August 11. Text is mainly in Chinese. Top to bottom: "Sham Shui Po, Anti-Extradition Bill (lit. 'anti-return to China'). The poster lists the starting point, meeting time, march start time, and final location, and says the march has obtained a letter of no objection. A list of slogans on the right reads: "A collective blossoming", "Five demands, not one lest", "Push aside corrupt help, return my Hong Kong", "Kick aside corrupt cops, a fair city", "Hong Kong People, awaken". ](images/thread1/t1-p18.jpg)

Fitting the other SW story we see ourselves in is TLJ. We are a desperate Resistance. We are Rose, saving what we love, even as we grieve. We are Luke, facing the might of the FO alone, asking our family to choose better,  buying time for our friends. We are the spark...

These may just be kids referencing what they know. But these modern shared myths have also helped HKers frame what we're going thru, because... it still feels surreal. But heroes standing up against evil? - a tale as old as time, we can wrap our heads around that.

(Also, I know the likes of @Russo_Brothers and @rianjohnson can't, won't, and probably shouldn't engage in a thread on HK protest art. But still want them to know their stories have left their mark, and inspired a people.) 

Apart from identifying with modern myths, HKers have also been active creating their own. The most prevalent is the distinction between the frontline 'braves', and the peaceful 'woleifei'[^1]. 

![An illustration of peaceful 'woleifei' protestors in black and white on a yellow background. The background contains the faint names of Hong Kong districts. Main caption reads: WE THE FEARLESS MAJORITY. Text in top right corner: Never Forget (English and Chinese). Text in bottom left: Eggs have never been alone (in Chinese).](images/thread1/t1-p20.jpg)  
*Text in bottom left: Eggs have never been alone.*
![An illustration of militant 'yungmo' frontline protestors in black, yellow and white, in front of outlines of umbrellas representing the peaceful 'woleifei' protestors behind them. Main caption reads: WE're MANY THEY're FEW. Text in top right corner: Never Forget (English and Chinese). Text in bottom left: Eggs never come alone (in Chinese).](images/thread1/t1-p21.jpg)  
*Text in bottom left: Eggs never come alone (in Chinese).*

The 'braves' have the most stunning art and posters. Because, I mean... just look at that imagery. We turn street signs into shields. We use mom's oven mitts to pick up tear gas canisters. We have our tennis rackets and umbrellas, in a city of fire and smoke. 

![A modified photo of a young woman, her face out of shot, holding a makeshift shield made from a road sign. She is wearing a black short-sleeved tshirt and heavy-duty black gloves, with a yellow hard hat hanging from her hip. The background is a foggy black-and-white photo of the Hong Kong skyline. Text, in white, reads: You'll never walk alone (English), Revolution of Our Times (Chinese), Aug 5,  general strike across Hong Kong (Chinese). At the bottom are two hashtags, #FUXKDAGOV and #FUXKDAPOLICE, and the other half of the slogan: Free Hong Kong Revolution Now (English), Liberate Hong Kong (Chinese).](images/thread1/t1-p22.jpg)

![A digital poster featuring a frontliner tossing back a burning tear gas canister. Text superimposed on top reads: We Fight.

More posters of the 'braves' in HK. A crew of masked and geared up young people, posed like reluctant heroes in some cyberpunk world. And always, the damn tear gas. 

![A photograph of a young frontliner in hard hat, goggles and respirator, standing against an out-of-focus backdrop of a street filled with protestors. It looks like the air is filled with gas and the glow suggests a fire in the back. Text on top, mainly English: Stand with HK. In Chinese: Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times. English: If We Burn, You Burn With Us. God Bless HK.](images/thread1/t1-p26.jpg)  
*Chinese text reads: Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times.*
![An illustration of seven frontline protestors standing in a dense cloud of smoke, some in hard hats, a few in just soft hats.

In the background are skyscrapers.](images/thread1/t1-p28.jpg)
![A modified photograph of a group of frontline protestors, holding makeshift shields, pouring water on a burning tear gas canister.

*Chinese text reads: Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times.*

There aren't many striking posters of the 'woleifei', because, as the myth goes, only the 'braves' do the striking. The closest we got are these, all of which are on the theme of the unity between the frontline and their more peaceful and rational brothers and sisters. 

![A very stylized yellow, black and white drawing of two faces, one in hard hat and respirator to represent a frontline brave, and one in a surgical mask for the 'woleifei'. The text reads: Together we will win.](images/thread1/t1-p30.jpg)
![Digitally altered photo in two halves. On the left is an image of a frontline brave in a hard hat, goggles and respirator. The Chinese character "brave" is behind him. On the right is an image of a protestor in a baseball cap and surgical mask waving a flag, on which is the slogan "Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our Times" written in Chinese. Behind this image is the Chinese character "Peace". Down the middle, "WE CONNECT" is written vertically. At the bottom is a caption reading "Six demands, not one less" in Chinese. ](images/thread1/t1-p31.jpg)
*Left background: "Brave". Right background: "Peaceful". On the flag is "Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times." At the bottom, "Six demands, not one less", referring to the additional demand of abolishing the Hong Kong police.*
![An illustration depicting a peaceful woleifei and brave yungmo protestor standing next to each other, holding hands in a human chain. Text across the top reads: We connect. Underneath that, in Chinese: "Not even a nuclear explosion would sever us."](images/thread1/t1-p32.jpg)  
*Chinese reads: "Not even a nuclear explosion would sever us."*

*Text in Chinese reads: Those who can come are all Hong Kongers!*

The idea of distinct roles - think RPGs where you've tanks, DPS and healers - makes for a nice, powerful myth and helped when we were first organising. The braves defend us! The woleifeis support us! But they at times also restrict us from seeing the reality.

Bravest Protestor with hard hat, goggles and respirator. In the center is a white bauhinia icon on a yellow background, and text reading: Either the way, we share the same goal.

The reality that the 'frontline' of resistance has changed. Students who join human chains. Housewives who shout out slogans at night. 'Gaifong's who protect kids and their neighborhoods form the HKPF. Musicians playing our anthem in a mall. They are all actively fighting. 

![t1-p35](images/thread1/t1-p35.jpg)
![t1-p36](images/thread1/t1-p36.jpg)
![t1-p37](images/thread1/t1-p37.jpg)

The reality that the our 'braves' are not invulnerable superhumans. They get tired. They get depressed. They are not some anonymous 'black bloc' with no personality. They are just ordinary humans, faced with extraordinary circumstances. They can be us. They are us. 

![t1-p38](images/thread1/t1-p38.jpg)
![t1-p39](images/thread1/t1-p39.jpg)

'Braves' or 'woleifei's isn't so important anymore - HKPF arrests everyone anyway. Line btw 'protestor' and HK citizen also artificial by now- when singing a song, posting on FB, jogging at night can be considered offensive acts, daily life becomes an act of resistance. 

![t1-p40](images/thread1/t1-p40.jpg)

We have to let go of some of the myths we've built around ourselves and our movement. 'Braves'/'woleifei' distinction makes it easy for others to portray this as a movement driven by a few 'radical protestors', when in fact it's HK citizens resisting. 

![t1-p41](images/thread1/t1-p41.jpg)

We must let go of seeing those geared up as invincible protectors of our city. Not because we're ungrateful - so many of them have bled and cried for HK during this summer of smoke. 

But that's it. The 'black bloc' shouldn't be our solution to this political crisis. This should never have been their burden to bear. Even the strongest umbrella can break. We must understand this, sympathise, see the human under the mask, and not glorify their hell. 

One last myth we have to let go of - that we're fighting against some unchangeable entity that has always been there, and will always be there, with meticulous plans stretching to infinity. Our city has existed as a colony longer than the giant has existed as a country.

China as the country we know now has only really come into being in the last 3 decades. Even during the last 10 years, there were rare periods of greater freedom. Even in the last 3 months, those we thought unbendable conceded something. Not enough, obviously, but...

... it means big 時代 changes are not impossible, that our 革命 may not be futile. After all, the Avengers found their 1 in 14mln chance. Luke saved his father. We must have hope, if not for ourselves, then for our stories to inspire all those to come who fight tyranny.

## Update, Oct 6, 2019

UPDATE - Star Wars protest art: We've actually had a few more. "Darkness rises, and light to meet it" frames the HKPF as the dark side, HKers as the light, ready for a final showdown... or a platonic hand-touching session in a hut in front of a roaring fire 😬 (All from TG/ Insta)

![t1-p43](images/thread1/t1-p43.jpg)

I have NO IDEA what this is. Is that *actually* Jesus with a lightsaber, protecting the back of one of our HK frontliners? Or is it an Obi-Wan who's let his beard grow out a bit? Either way, the pic is cute, and suggests god/the Force is with us.

![t1-p44](images/thread1/t1-p44.jpg)

UPDATE - Avengers/superhero protest art: The antimask law's inspired some interesting pieces. This suggests it's akin to the Superhuman Registration Act which forces heroes to unmask. In which case, neither Iron Man nor Spidey shld look so dour but this is cool art, so shush! 🤓

![t1-p45](images/thread1/t1-p45.jpg)

Things are dire, but we've kept our sense of humor. The left says antimask law means Iron Man now needs to take off his mask if he flies into HK. On the right, Thor is a frontline 'brave', and Cap is one of the peaceful woleifeis (hehe) - they must work together to save HK.

### Notes
[^1]: "Woleifei" is a phonetic transliteration of the term in Chinese, 和理非. It is an abbreviation for 和平，理性，非暴力, *peaceful, rational, non-violent*.
