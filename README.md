**Why aren't the artists credited?**

For safety reasons, I have not included links to artists' source by default, except for those that have explicitly noted they want their social media accounts or other details spread.

**What about other Hong Kong protest art threads?**

There are many very good threads or collections of Hong Kong protest art out there! I urge you to keep your own archives to keep them circulating. However, I decided that the focus of this particular project and archive will be on a single author's set of Hong Kong protest art threads - which is why I have not included threads linked by the original poster, that were created by another user.
